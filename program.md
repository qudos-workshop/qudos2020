This is based on their  respective work in rigorous research and the reality of what teams are  building and deploying in large, complex systems using DevOps and Agile  methodologies.<br /><br />The  research outlines specific capabilities to improve software delivery,  but the reality is that many teams are struggling to take these steps  towards transformation. And what many practitioners don’t realize is that the world of automated testing has  changed; by embracing the state of the art, they can truly transform  their software quality and delivery.<br /><br />Join Nicole and Angie as they discuss:<br />* What practices development teams are currently following<br />* The debunking of common myths and misconceptions around test automation in DevOps<br />* How development teams can adopt the guidelines found in the research, while facing the reality of their current constraints<br /><br /><br />**Bios:** <br />* **Angie Jones** is a Java Champion and Senior Developer Advocate who specializes  in test automation strategies and techniques. She shares her wealth of  knowledge by speaking and teaching at software conferences all over the world, writing tutorials and  technical articles on angiejones.tech, and leading the online learning  platform, Test Automation University. As a  Master Inventor, Angie is known for her innovative and out-of-the-box  thinking style which has resulted in more than 25 patented inventions in the US and China. In her spare time, Angie volunteers with Black Girls Code to teach coding workshops  to young girls in an effort to attract more women and minorities to  tech.<br /><br />* **Dr.  Nicole Forsgren** is the VP of Research & Strategy at GitHub. She is  author of the Shingo Publication Award-winning book Accelerate: The  Science of Lean Software and DevOps and is best known as lead investigator on the largest DevOps studies to  date. She has been a successful entrepreneur (with an exit to Google),  professor, performance engineer, and sysadmin. Her work has been  published in several peer-reviewed journals. |
