This is based on their  respective work in rigorous research and the reality of what teams are  building and deploying in large, complex systems using DevOps and Agile  methodologies.<br />The  research outlines specific capabilities to improve software delivery,  but the reality is that many teams are struggling to take these steps  towards transformation. And what many practitioners don’t realize is that the world of automated testing has  changed; by embracing the state of the art, they can truly transform  their software quality and delivery.<br />Join Nicole and Angie as they discuss:<br />* What practices development teams are currently following<br />* The debunking of common myths and misconceptions around test automation in DevOps<br />* How development teams can adopt the guidelines found in the research, while facing the reality of their current constraints |
