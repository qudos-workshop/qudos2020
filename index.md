DevOps extends the agile development principles to include the full stack of software services, from design to execution, enabling and promoting collaboration of operations, quality assurance, and development engineers throughout the entire service lifecycle. Ultimately, DevOps is a process that enables faster releases of a better product to the end user. DevOps encompasses a set of values, principles, methods, practices, and tools, to accelerate software delivery to the customer by means of infrastructure as code, 
continuous integration and deployment, automated testing and monitoring, or new architectural styles such as microservices. In the end all common software engineering activities, organizational forms and processes have to be questioned, adapted and extended to ensure continuous and unobstructed software
development, this is the aim of continuous software engineering (CSE) research. Current software engineering research mainly deals with the development aspects of DevOps and CSE, focusing on development methods, practices, and tools, leaving the quality assurance aspects of DevOps behind.

Even though development practices such as testing (at all levels) are instrumental in producing quality software, they mostly deal with the functional correctness, while quality assurance deals with a more broadly defined concept of quality, of which functional correctness is just one dimension. However, DevOps needs methods and tools that enable systematic assessment, prediction, and management of software quality in other dimensions as well, including performance, reliability, safety, survivability, or cost of ownership.

The QUDOS workshop provides a forum for experts from academia and industry to present and discuss novel quality-aware methods, practices and tools for DevOps. On the other hand, the goal of the CSE workshop is to present and discuss innovative solutions, ideas and experiences in the area of continuity 
along the entire software engineering lifecycle hence, Continuous Software Engineering. 

For the second time, the CSE and and QUDOS workshops join forces to foster cross-fertilization and bootstrap an even bigger, stronger community around the urgently emerging topics they are both addressing from different angles. Especially industry practitioners are invited to join this community and present challenges, solutions and lessons learned from real and complex projects.

The Joint CSE/QUDOS Workshop 2020 is organized and technically sponsored by the Research Group (RG) and the DevOps Performance Working Group of the [Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC RG)](http://research.spec.org), and by the consortium of the EU project [RADON](http://radon-h2020.eu/). The workshop is also supported by the [IFIP Working Group on Service Oriented Systems](http://ifip-wg-sos.deib.polimi.it/)  and the [GI Working Group Microservices and DevOps](https://ak-msdo.gi.de/).
